## Inventory Management App

**Description:** I would like to create an app to help managers track their store's inventory. If an item was out of stock on the sales floor, the manager could add the item to an inventory list. The item could then be color-coded, depending on its availability. For example, if the item was out of stock on the sales floor, but not out of stock in inventory, the manager could add a green flag. This would signal that the item simply needed to be restocked from the backroom. Managers could also add their own notes to each product if specific information needed to be tracked.

**Extension:** Eventually, I would like to convert this to a mobile app so that managers could check inventory from their phone while on the sales floor. I would also allow managers to log in and adjust inventory and item locations directly from the app. To extend this app further, I would like managers to be able to email vendors about a product.
