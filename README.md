# Inventory Management App

I would like to create an app to help managers quickly track their store's inventory.  If an item was out on the sales floor, the manager could simply search for the item by number, name, or location.  The item could then be color-coded, depending on the situation. For example, if the item was out on the sales floor, but not out of stock in inventory, the manager could add a green flag.  This would signal that the item simply needed to be restocked from the backroom.  Managers could also add their own notes to each product if specific information needed to be tracked.

Eventually, I would like to convert this to a mobile app so that managers could check inventory from their phone while on the sales floor. I would also like to allow managers to log in and adjust inventory and item locations directly from the app.  To extend this app further, I would like managers to be able to email the Main Office directly about a product using the app.
